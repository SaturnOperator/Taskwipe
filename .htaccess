# By default ngRoute links are in this format 'domain.com/#/page'. By adding this script, it automatically redirects links to the right page when visiting a url in this format: 'domain.com/page'. Without redirecting, you end up with a 404 page not found error. Please note, you must also have these configurations in your apache2.conf file (/etc/apache2/apache2.conf): 

#	<Directory /var/www/>
#		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
#		AllowOverride All
#		Require all granted
#	</Directory>


<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    Options +FollowSymlinks
    RewriteEngine On
    # Don't rewrite files or directories
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
    RewriteRule ^ - [L]

    # Rewrite everything else to index.html to allow html5 state links
    RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]
</IfModule>
